# ProofChecker
Library for checking formally constructed proofs.

# Usage
## What This Library Has:
Objects and classes representing Formlae and deductive steps. It also
provides the necessary interfaces required to fully check a mathematical
proof.

## What This Library Does Not Have:
This library is not an automated proving system: Proofs must be
constructed either by hand or by some other system, and 
knoweledge bases required for checking proofs are maintained by
the client.
